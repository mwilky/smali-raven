<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><config><compat-change description="Components of apps targeting Android T and above will stop receiving intents from external callers that do not match its declared intent filters. When an app registers an exported component in its manifest and adds an &lt;intent-filter&gt;, the component can be started by any intent - even those that do not match the intent filter. This has proven to be something that many developers find counterintuitive. Without checking the intent when the component is started, in some circumstances this can allow 3P apps to trigger internal-only functionality." enableSinceTargetSdk="33" id="161252188" name="ENFORCE_INTENTS_TO_MATCH_INTENT_FILTERS"><meta-data definedIn="com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerServiceUtils" sourcePosition="frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageManagerServiceUtils.java:151"/></compat-change></config>
